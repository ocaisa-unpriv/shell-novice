### Contexto

Los seres humanos y las computadoras suelen interactuar de muchas maneras diferentes, como a través de un teclado y ratón, interfaces, de pantalla táctil o usando sistemas de reconocimiento de voz. La forma más utilizada para interactuar con ordenadores personales se llama **interfaz gráfica de usuario** (GUI). Con un GUI, damos instrucciones haciendo clic en el ratón y usando interacciones guiadas por menús.

Mientras que la ayuda visual de un GUI hace intuitivo aprender, esta forma de entregar instrucciones a un ordenador se escala muy mal. Imagine la siguiente tarea: para una búsqueda de literatura, tienes que copiar la tercera línea de mil archivos de texto en mil directorios diferentes y pegarlo en un solo archivo. Usando una interfaz GUI, no sólo haría clic en su escritorio durante varias horas, pero potencialmente también podría cometer un error en el proceso de completar esta tarea repetitiva. Aquí es donde aprovechamos el shell de Unix. The Unix shell is both a **command-line interface** (CLI) and a scripting language, allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast. With the proper commands, the shell can repeat tasks with or without some modification as many times as we want. Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be accomplished in seconds.

### The Shell

The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell, it's possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one line of code. The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again SHell --- so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne). Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows. Note that 'Git Bash' is a piece of software that enables Windows users to use a Bash like interface when interacting with Git.

Using the shell will take some effort and some time to learn. While a GUI presents you with choices to select, CLI choices are not automatically presented to you, so you must learn a few commands like new vocabulary in a language you're studying. However, unlike a spoken language, a small number of "words" (i.e. commands) gets you a long way, and we'll cover those essential few today.

The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of commands can be written into a *script*, improving the reproducibility of workflows.

In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers. Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources including high-performance computing systems. As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching, being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill. We can build on the command-line skills covered here to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.

Let's get started.

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a **prompt**, indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

```bash
$
```

The shell typically uses `$` as the prompt, but may use a different symbol. In the examples for this lesson, we'll show the prompt as `$`. Most importantly, *do not type the prompt* when typing commands. Only type the command that follows the prompt. This rule applies both in these lessons and in lessons from other sources. Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute it.

The prompt is followed by a **text cursor**, a character that indicates the position where your typing will appear. The cursor is usually a flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a pipe. You may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.

Note that your prompt might look a little different. In particular, most popular shell environments by default put your user name and the host name before the `$`. Such a prompt might look like, e.g.:

```bash
nelle@localhost $
```

The prompt might even include more than this. Do not worry if your prompt is not just a short `$`. This lesson does not depend on this additional information and it should also not get in your way. The only important item to focus on is the `$` character itself and we will see later why.

So let's try our first command, `ls`, which is short for listing. This command will list the contents of the current directory:

```bash
$ ls
```

```output
Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Command not found

If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed, it will print an error message such as:

```bash
$ ks
```

```output
ks: command not found
```

Esto puede suceder si el comando fue mal escrito o si el programa correspondiente a ese comando no está instalado.

## Pipeline de Nelle: Un problema típico

Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist, has just returned from a six-month survey of the [North Pacific Gyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre), where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch). She has 1520 samples that she's run through an assay machine to measure the relative abundance of 300 proteins. She needs to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called `goostats.sh`. In addition to this huge task, she has to write up results by the end of the month, so her paper can appear in a special issue of *Aquatic Goo Letters*.

If Nelle chooses to run `goostats.sh` by hand using a GUI, she'll have to select and open a file 1520 times. If `goostats.sh` takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole process will take more than 12 hours of Nelle's attention. With the shell, Nelle can instead assign her computer this mundane task while she focuses her attention on writing her paper.

The next few lessons will explore the ways Nelle can achieve this. More specifically, the lessons explain how she can use a command shell to run the `goostats.sh` program, using loops to automate the repetitive steps of entering file names, so that her computer can work while she writes her paper.

As a bonus, once she has put a processing pipeline together, she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.

In order to achieve her task, Nelle needs to know how to:

- navigate to a file/directory
- create a file/directory
- check the length of a file
- chain commands together
- retrieve a set of files
- iterate over files
- run a shell script containing her pipeline



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Un intérprete de comandos es un programa cuyo propósito principal es leer comandos y ejecutar otros programas.
- Esta lección utiliza Bash, el intérprete de comandos predeterminado en muchas implementaciones de Unix.
- Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt.
- The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines.
- A significant challenge when using the shell can be knowing what commands need to be run and how to run them.
